# Appreciation
This module allows players to obtain two services. They can get a level boost to 60, 70 or 80 which includes equipment equal to what they would get from quests or they can unlock flight paths in each continent. Choosing one doesn't disable the other.

There is a config option that makes it so they need a **Certificate of Appreciation** to be able to use these services. It's also possible to send the player one of these certificates when reaching max level.

The certificate uses an already existing item so in order for it to display correctly you have to delete the client cache.

The item id of the certificate is **20460** and it is set up like an heirloom so it can be sent to other characters on the same account.

By default the NPC that provides these services are located in Stormwind City, Orgrimmar and Dalaran. The one in Stormwind City can be found outside the bank in the Trade District, the one in Orgimmar can be found outside Spiritfury Reagents in the Valley of Strength and the one in Dalaran can be found near the central fountain.
